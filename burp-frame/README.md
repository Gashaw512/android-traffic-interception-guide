## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Unified CLI**: A singular, intuitive command-line interface for orchestrating all Android pentesting operations, simplifying complex workflows.
    
-   **Certificate Installation (`install` module)**:
    
    -   **One-command certificate installation** of Burp Suite CA certificates directly onto the Android device.
        
    -   **Automates conversion** of Burp CA certificates from DER format to the Android-compatible `.0` format, complete with subject hash calculation.
        
    -   **Intelligent deployment**: Pushes converted certificates to the traditional `/system/etc/security/cacerts/` path, or leverages the systemless capabilities of Magisk.
        
    -   **Magisk Support**: Specifically designed to install certificates seamlessly into the systemless Magisk path, maintaining system integrity.
        
    -   **Dry-run mode**: Allows simulation of the entire certificate installation process without making any actual modifications to the device, ideal for testing and verification.
        
-   **Proxy Management (`proxy` module)**:
    
    -   **Flexible global HTTP proxy settings**: Easily set and clear system-wide HTTP proxy configurations on the Android device via ADB for comprehensive traffic interception.
        
    -   **(Conceptual) Per-application proxy settings**: Provides a framework for managing proxy settings for specific applications, though practical effectiveness may vary across Android versions and app implementations.
        
    -   **Connectivity testing**: Includes functionality to test the configured global proxy's connectivity, ensuring your interception setup is active and correctly routing traffic.
        
    -   **Network intelligence**: Discover and display active network interfaces and their associated IP addresses on the connected device.
        
-   **Frida Integration (`frida` module)**:
    
    -   **Automated Frida server deployment**: Deploys the appropriate `frida-server` binary to the connected Android device based on its architecture and intelligently attempts to start it in the background.
        
    -   **Process management**: List all running processes on the device, and kill processes efficiently by either their PID or package name.
        
    -   **Script injection**: Launch target applications with a custom Frida JavaScript script immediately injected, enabling early instrumentation.
        
    -   **Advanced Certificate Re-Pinning Bypass**: A specialized Frida capability to inject a custom CA certificate (like your Burp CA) directly into an application's trust store at runtime, effectively bypassing SSL pinning even when traditional certificate installation methods fail.
        
-   **SSL Pinning & Security Bypasses (`bypass-ssl` & `universal-bypass` modules)**:
    
    -   **Generic SSL Bypass**: Facilitates the management (listing, downloading) and application of general-purpose Frida scripts designed to bypass various forms of SSL pinning implemented in Android applications.
        
    - **Comprehensive Universal Bypass**: It provides **one-shot bypassing of common Android security mechanisms** directly from your terminal. Deploys a **powerful, all-in-one Frida  script (enhanced with the latest techniques)** to comprehensively bypass multiple crucial security checks, including:
      - **SSL pinning:** Covering multiple methods including OkHttp, Conscrypt, and HostnameVerifier.
      - **Root detection:** Bypassing checks via filesystem anomalies, Runtime exec calls, SystemProperties, and common libraries like RootBeer.
      - **Debugger checks:** Circumventing detection mechanisms for attached debuggers.
      - **Emulator checks:** Masking indicators that reveal an application is running in an emulated environment.

-   **Device Management (`device` module)**:
    
    -   **Essential device control**: Remotely reboot the connected Android device.
        
    -   **File system manipulation**: Remount the `/system` partition as either read-write (`remount-rw`) or read-only (`remount-ro`), crucial for system-level modifications (requires root).
        
    -   **Device discovery**: List all currently connected ADB devices and their properties.
        
    -   **Application lifecycle management**: Effortlessly install and uninstall APKs onto the device.
        
    -   **Flexible connectivity**: Connect to and disconnect from ADB devices over TCP/IP (e.g., for Wi-Fi debugging).
        
-   **Automation & Usability**:
    
    -   **Automated cleanup**: Ensures all temporary certificate files and directories created by the framework are removed upon application exit.
        
    -   **Interactive and intelligent CLI**: Provides clear prompts, auto-validation of inputs, and helpful, context-aware messages to guide the user.
        
    -   **Detailed logging**: Generates timestamped, categorized logs to a dedicated `logs/` directory, essential for auditing, troubleshooting, and documenting pentesting activities.
        
    -   **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Fully supports Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

## üì¶ Requirements

- **Python 3.7+** The framework is built on modern Python features.
- **[ADB (Android Debug Bridge)](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)** The primary tool for device communication. Ensure it's installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) available in `PATH`. It is required for certificate conversions. Ensure it's installed and available in your PATH.
- **Frida CLI (frida-tools):** Install via `pip install frida-tools` (note: `pip install frida` also covers the Python library requirement).
- **Frida Server:** The on-device component of Frida. `burp-frame frida deploy` automates its download and deployment, requiring a working internet connection for the initial setup.
- **Rooted Android device or emulator** Essential for modifying system partitions (e.g., for certificate installation) and for many advanced Frida operations.  (e.g., [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/), or Magisk-patched Android Virtual Devices (AVDs))
- **Burp Suite CA certificate** Exported as a `.der` format file from Burp Suite. This is necessary for the `install` command and the `frida cert-repin` functionality.

## üöÄ Installation

### Option 1: From PyPI (recommended)

For the easiest installation, use pip:

```bash
pip install burp-frame

```

### Option 2: From source

For development or to access the latest features, clone the repository and install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gashaw512/android-traffic-interception-guide
cd android-traffic-interception-guide/ # Navigate to the project root directory
pip install . # Installs the 'burp-frame' package from the current directory

```

> ‚úÖ **Tip**: Always use a Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html "null") (`python -m venv .venv` then `source .venv/bin/activate`) to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with system-wide Python packages.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start

Follow these steps to get started quickly with `burp-frame`:

### 1. Configure External Tool Paths

Before `burp-frame` can operate, you must tell it where to find your `adb` and `openssl` executables. You can also configure paths for Frida binaries if they are not in your system's `PATH`.

```
# Example for Windows:
burp-frame config --adb "C:\path\to\your\platform-tools\adb.exe" --openssl "C:\path\to\OpenSSL\bin\openssl.exe"

# Example for Linux/macOS:
burp-frame config --adb "/usr/local/bin/adb" --openssl "/usr/bin/openssl"

```

You can verify your current configuration settings at any time:

```bash
burp-frame config

```

### 2. Connect Your Android Device

Ensure your Android device (physical or emulator) is properly connected and recognized by ADB.

-   Enable **USB debugging** on your Android phone or emulator (typically found in Developer Options).
    
-   Verify your device is detected by ADB:
    
```bash
    adb devices
    
```
    

### 3. Deploy Frida Server

For all Frida-related commands to function, the `frida-server` must be running on your Android device. `burp-frame` automates this process:

```bash
burp-frame frida deploy

```

üìö **FAQ**

### How do I export the certificate from Burp?
Go to: `Proxy ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Import/Export CA Certificate`. Choose DER format and save the file (e.g., `burp.der`).

### Why does burp-frame require root access for certificate installation?
Android mandates that trusted CA certificates are installed into the system's certificate store, which resides in a protected `/system` partition. Modifying this partition requires root privileges. Magisk provides a systemless way to do this.

### My emulator isn't rooted. What now?
`burp-frame` requires root access for system-level certificate installation and many advanced Frida operations. Use one of the following:
- ‚úÖ **Genymotion** (emulators are rooted by default).
- ‚úÖ **Magisk-patched AVDs** (Android Virtual Devices).
- ‚úÖ **Custom rooted emulator images**.

### adb remount fails?
This is usually due to `dm-verity` issues on the device. Ensure the device is rooted and consider disabling `dm-verity` if necessary.
